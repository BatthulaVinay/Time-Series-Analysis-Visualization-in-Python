# Time Series Analysis & Visualization in Python

## Overview
This project demonstrates time series analysis and visualization techniques using Python. The dataset consists of stock market data, and the project includes various preprocessing, statistical tests, and visualization techniques to analyze trends and patterns over time.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, removing unnecessary columns)
- Time series visualization using line plots
- Statistical analysis (ADF test for stationarity)
- Autocorrelation analysis (ACF plots)
- Resampling and aggregation of time series data

## Dataset
- The dataset used is `stock_data.csv`
- It contains stock market data with columns like `Date`, `High`, and others
- The `Date` column is set as the index for time-based operations

## Libraries Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Statsmodels

## Installation & Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/time-series-analysis.git
   cd time-series-analysis
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. **Open and execute** the `Time Series Analysis & Visualization in Python.ipynb` file.

## Results & Evaluation
- Time series plots help visualize stock price trends
- ADF test determines stationarity of the time series
- ACF plots analyze correlations over time

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing ARIMA models for forecasting
- Applying Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL)
- Building an interactive dashboard with Plotly or Streamlit
